Topic: Clustering Techniques and Applications

 

Techniques

K-Means

Another clustering method for comparison

 

Task 1: 2D Artificial Datasets

To demonstrate the influence of data patterns

To demonstrate the influence of algorithm factors

 

Task 2: Image Segmentation

Gray vs. Colour

 

Deliverables:

Reports  (experiment specification, algorithm parameters, in-depth analysis)

Code (any programming language, with detailed comments)
